In-situ heat flux measurements for micro-pin-fin heat sinks are extremely important for performance modeling and optimization but notoriously difficult to obtain.
My master's thesis research focused on design, fabrication and testing of a nickel-based 4-wire resistance temperature detector (RTD) heat flux sensor on an individual copper pin.
The sensor was to be used for heat transfer studies within a micro-pin-fin heat sink (collaboration with the University of Hawaii at Manoa).
As the research assistant on the project, I performed all stages of development.
Sensor design included signal sensitivity analysis and heat transfer modeling in Matlab.
Fabrication of the sensors included bulk copper substrate preparation and traditional micro-lithography techniques.
Machining of the 3D pin structure and device segmentation was performed using micro-end-milling.
Heat flux testing and calibration utilized an Nd-YAG laser with specialized data acquisition system acquired for the project.
