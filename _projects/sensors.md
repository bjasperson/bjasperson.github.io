While completing my master's degree, I designed, fabricated and tested a nickel-based 4-wire resistance temperature detector (RTD) heat flux sensor on an individual copper pin. The sensor was to be used for heat transfer studies within a micro-pin-fin heat sink (collaboration with the University of Hawaii at Manoa). Sensor fabrication was performed using a combination of lithographic procedures on a custom copper wafer. Machining of the 3D pin structure and device segmentation was performed using micro-end-milling.
