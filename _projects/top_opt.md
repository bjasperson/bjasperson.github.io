My research has been focused on using machine learning to perform multiphysics topology optimization of optically broadband shuttering elements. Specifically, I am exploring using coupled neural networks to replace the traditional solver calls in the optimization process. The neural networks predict device performance and optimize the distribution of material through backpropagation during neural network training. The devices utilize a phase change material (vanadium dioxide) to achieve the shuttering effect.
