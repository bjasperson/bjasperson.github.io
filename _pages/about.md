I am currently a PhD student in the Theoretical and Applied Mechanics department at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign.  I am advised by Professor Harley Johnson. My current research topic involves optimization of non-linear optical materials and structures using machine learning. I am also a member of the DIGI-MAT program.  

Previously, I received my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in mechanical engineering from the University of Wisconsin - Madison. I also worked for ~10 years as a design engineer on products ranging from healthcare devices to neutron generators.
