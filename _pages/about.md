I am a PhD candidate in the [Theoretical and Applied Mechanics](https://mechse.illinois.edu/graduate/graduate-degree-programs/phd-programs/phd-theoretical-and-applied-mechanics) program at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.
I am also a member of the [DIGI-MAT program](https://digi-mat.ncsa.illinois.edu/).
I am advised by Professor Harley Johnson.

My research focuses on optimizing designs and computational models to solve mechanics-based problems.
My recent projects include work in topology optimization as well as atomistic methods (interatomic modeling).
I'm especially interested in using data-driven methods and machine learning in solving these problems.
Although my current research is focused on computational methods, I did experimental research (design, fabrication and testing) during my Master's degree program.

I received my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in mechanical engineering from the University of Wisconsin - Madison.
I also worked for ~10 years as a design engineer on products ranging from healthcare devices to neutron generators.
