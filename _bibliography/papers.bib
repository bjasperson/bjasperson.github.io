	abstract = {This study concerns pressure drop of adiabatic water liquid-vapor two-phase flow across an array of 1950 staggered square micro-pin-fins having a 200Ã—200 micron cross-section by a 670 micron height. The ratios of longitudinal pitch and transverse pitch to pin-fin equivalent diameter are equal to 2. An inline immersion heater upstream of the micro-pin-fin test module was employed to produce liquid-vapor two-phase mixture, which flowed across the micro-pin-fin array. The test module was well insulated to maintain an adiabatic condition. Four maximum mass velocities of 184, 235, 337, and 391 kg/m2s, and a range of vapor qualities for each maximum mass velocity were tested. Measured pressure drop increases drastically with increasing vapor quality. Nine existing two-phase pressure drop models and correlations were assessed. The Lockhart-Martinelli correlation for laminar liquid-laminar vapor combination in conjunction with a single-phase friction factor correlation proposed for the present micro-pin-fin array provided the best agreement with the data.},

	abstract = {A combination of lithography-based microfabrication and micro end milling is used to manufacture thin-film resistance temperature detector (RTD) heat flux sensors on bulk copper substrates. The fabrication process uses photoresist patterning, metal deposition, and lift-off to build the sensor and micro-end milling to segment the sensors. Micro end milling tests were performed to establish determine the optimum conditions for sensor removal which minimized delamination and burr formation. It was determined that starting on the backside (opposite the sensor) of the copper wafer and machining through to the thin film layers resulted in the least amount of burr formation.},
