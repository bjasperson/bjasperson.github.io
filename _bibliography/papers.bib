  abstract = {Correlations between fundamental microscopic properties computable from first principles, which we term canonical properties, and complex large-scale quantities of interest (QoIs) provide an avenue to predictive materials discovery. We propose that such correlations can be efficiently discovered through simulations utilizing approximate interatomic potentials (IPs), which serve as an ensemble of "synthetic materials." As a proof of principle we build a regression model relating canonical properties to the symmetric tilt grain boundary (GB) energy curves in face-centered cubic crystals, characterized by the scaling factor in the universal lattice matching model of Runnels et al. (2016), which we take to be our QoI. Our analysis recovers known correlations of GB energy to other properties and discovers new ones. We also demonstrate, using available density functional theory (DFT) GB energy data, that the regression model constructed from IP data is consistent with DFT results, confirming the assumption that the IPs and DFT belong to same statistical pool and thereby validating the approach. Regression models constructed in this fashion can be used to predict large-scale QoIs based on first-principles data and provide a general method for training IPs for QoIs beyond the scope of first-principles calculations.},

  abstract = {A simulation can stand its ground against experiment only if its prediction uncertainty is known. The unknown accuracy of interatomic potentials (IPs) is a major source of prediction uncertainty, severely limiting the use of large-scale classical atomistic simulations in a wide range of scientific and engineering applications. Here we explore covariance between predictions of metal plasticity, from 178 large-scale (\$\textbackslash sim 10\textasciicircum 8\$ atoms) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and a variety of indicator properties computed at small-scales (\$\textbackslash leq 10\textasciicircum 2\$ atoms). All simulations use the same 178 IPs. In a manner similar to statistical studies in public health, we analyze correlations of strength with indicators, identify the best predictor properties, and build a cross-scale ``strength-on-predictors'' regression model. This model is then used to quantify uncertainty over the statistical pool of IPs. Small-scale predictors found to be highly covariant with strength are computed using expensive quantum-accurate calculations and used to predict flow strength, within the uncertainty bounds established in our statistical study.},

	abstract = {This study concerns pressure drop of adiabatic water liquid-vapor two-phase flow across an array of 1950 staggered square micro-pin-fins having a 200Ã—200 micron cross-section by a 670 micron height. The ratios of longitudinal pitch and transverse pitch to pin-fin equivalent diameter are equal to 2. An inline immersion heater upstream of the micro-pin-fin test module was employed to produce liquid-vapor two-phase mixture, which flowed across the micro-pin-fin array. The test module was well insulated to maintain an adiabatic condition. Four maximum mass velocities of 184, 235, 337, and 391 kg/m2s, and a range of vapor qualities for each maximum mass velocity were tested. Measured pressure drop increases drastically with increasing vapor quality. Nine existing two-phase pressure drop models and correlations were assessed. The Lockhart-Martinelli correlation for laminar liquid-laminar vapor combination in conjunction with a single-phase friction factor correlation proposed for the present micro-pin-fin array provided the best agreement with the data.},

The fabrication process uses photoresist patterning, metal deposition, and lift-off to build the sensor and micro-end milling to segment the sensors. Micro end milling tests were performed to establish determine the optimum conditions for sensor removal which minimized delamination and burr formation. It was determined that starting on the backside (opposite the sensor) of the copper wafer and machining through to the thin film layers resulted in the least amount of burr formation.},
