I'm excited to announce that our recent work exploring cross-scale covariance for material property prediction has been published in npj Computational Materials. 
This work is the result of a wonderful collaboration between the University of Minnesota (Ilia Nikiforov, Ellad Tadmor), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (Amit Samanta, Fei Zhou, Vincenzo Lordi, and Vasily Bulatov), and the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.
You can find all the details in our article, [here](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41524-024-01453-w).
