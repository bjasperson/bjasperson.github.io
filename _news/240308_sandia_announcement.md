Our recent work with Michael Wood was highlighted in the Sandia National Laboratories Collaboration Report for 2022-2023.
You can see the article [here](https://www.sandia.gov/research/?r3d=2022-2023-sandia-labs-academic-programs-collaboration-report#1), pg 58-59.
I have truly enjoyed being a part of this great collaboration!
