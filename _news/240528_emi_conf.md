If you are heading to EMI/PMC 2024 in Chicago this week, please stop by the Buckingham Room on Wednesday, May 29 at 11:30am. 
I will be presenting our recent work, as seen in [MRS Advances](https://rdcu.be/dAEAX). 
As a part of the talk, I will describe how we transitioned our dual neural network topology optimization algorithm to aid in fitting interatomic potentials.
This initial proof-of-concept work could eventually be used to aid in efficiently fitting an interatomic potential for large scale properties of interest, e.g. grain boundary energy and plastic flow strength.
